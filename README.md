Coding questions in Exa Data:
While I worked for Exa Data, I submitted them to Exa Data and set the repository to be private later. There should be no argument with Exa Data.

I previously committed them to Github and set them to be public; however, I occasionally set the repository to be private; thus, if you see someone's code that looks similar to mine, it is normal.


I mean, I committed them to Github (public), then set the repository to be private or deleted themâ€”just my habit. Sometimes, I feel my code is not clean enough due to time limitations. I will make the repositories public later.

In case of plagiarism, once I set it to public, I will not change it back to private again.
